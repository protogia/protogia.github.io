Iâ€™m Giancarlo Rizzo, and this is my personal website. I use this simple webpage to share personal projects and as a place to save documentation I write along the way. My formal education is in automotive and systems engineering but I am passionate about a lot of stuff around software developement and electrical engineering.

Dont hesitate to contact me and take a look at my work!
